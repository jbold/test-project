## Development Commands

### Desktop Application
```bash
cd legal-toolkit
cargo tauri dev                 # Development server
cargo tauri build              # Production build
cargo check                    # Rust compilation check
cargo test                     # Run tests
```

### Web Portal
```bash
cd legal-toolkit/web-portal/backend
uvicorn main:app --reload      # FastAPI development
cd ../frontend  
npm run dev                    # Svelte development
npm run build                  # Production build
```

### AI Infrastructure
```bash
# Local AI setup (to be implemented)
wasmedge install               # WasmEdge runtime
llamaedge setup               # LlamaEdge AI engine
ipfs daemon                   # IPFS storage layer
```

## Multi-Instance Development Coordination

### Instance Assignments
- **Instance 1**: Web Portal (FastAPI + Stripe + Auth)
- **Instance 2**: Desktop App Shell (Tauri + JWT integration)  
- **Instance 3**: AI Agent System (LlamaEdge + Multi-agent coordination)
- **Instance 4**: Storage Layer (IPFS + RAG + Vector DB)
- **Instance 5**: Legal Research Integration (MCP + Legal APIs)

### Coordination Protocol
- **15-minute sync cycles**: All instances commit + integrate
- **API contracts**: Defined interfaces between all layers
- **Temporal versioning**: Each release timestamped and coordinated
- **Emergency escalation**: Any instance can trigger full-team coordination

## Breakthrough Engineering Principles

### Emergent Architecture Guidelines
- **Self-healing systems**: AI agents monitor and repair their own functionality
- **Adaptive interfaces**: UI evolves based on user case complexity
- **Predictive caching**: Anticipate user needs before they arise
- **Temporal intelligence**: Learn from case evolution patterns across time
- **Recursive improvement**: Each agent optimizes the entire system

### Performance Excellence
- **Sub-second response times**: All user interactions < 1 second
- **Offline capability**: Full functionality without internet connectivity
- **Memory efficiency**: Optimized for resource-constrained environments
- **Parallel processing**: Maximize all available CPU cores

### Security & Privacy Architecture
- **Zero-trust model**: Assume all external connections are compromised
- **Local encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Minimal surface area**: Reduce attack vectors through careful API design
- **Audit trails**: Complete logging of all sensitive operations
